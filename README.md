# Alfred-Screenshot-to-Clipboard
This workflow is a quick way to copy screenshots to the clipboard. Choose between full screen capture, window capture, or selection mode.

No arguments = screenshot entire screen

-w = window selection mode

-s = freehand selection mode

Example Usage: cs -w (window selection), cs -s (freehand selection), cs (screenshot all)

Additional arguments are available but not necessarily supported here. Feel free to experiment (Hint: type 'screencapture -h' in terminal for a list of available commands)
